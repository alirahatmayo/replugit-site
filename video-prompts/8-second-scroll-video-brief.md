# 8-Second Scroll Transformation Video Prompt

## ðŸŽ¬ **Google Veo 3 Main Prompt**

```
Create an 8-second cinematic video showing 5 damaged laptops in a row that magically transform into pristine retail-ready condition. Camera smoothly pans horizontally from left to right (mimicking website scroll behavior). Each laptop transforms with a magical shimmer effect in green (#10B981) as it enters the center of the frame. Start with dim industrial lighting on severely damaged devices (cracked screens, missing keys, scratched cases), transition to bright premium retail lighting on perfect Grade A laptops. End with text overlay "Scroll into Grade A quality" and subtle Replugit branding. Professional product photography style with smooth gimbal movement and subtle particle effects during transformation.
```

**Duration**: 8 seconds  
**Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (1920x1080)  
**Style**: Cinematic product transformation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Concept Breakdown**

### The Scroll Metaphor

- **Camera pans horizontally** = Website scrolling motion
- **Devices transform as they enter center frame** = Scroll-triggered animations
- **Progressive revelation** = Content appearing as user scrolls
- **Smooth continuous motion** = Smooth scrolling experience

### Transformation Sequence (8 seconds)

1. **0-1s**: Static shot of 5 severely damaged laptops
2. **1-3s**: Camera begins smooth pan, first transformation begins
3. **3-6s**: Middle laptops transform with green shimmer effects
4. **6-8s**: Final reveal, all pristine, text overlay appears

## ðŸ”„ **Web Integration Strategy**

### Scroll-Triggered Video Playback

```javascript
// Concept for implementation
const video = document.querySelector(".hero-video");
const scrollTrigger = () => {
  const scrollPercent = window.scrollY / window.innerHeight;
  const videoTime = Math.min(scrollPercent * 8, 8); // 8 second video
  video.currentTime = videoTime;
};
window.addEventListener("scroll", scrollTrigger);
```

### User Experience Flow

1. **Page loads**: Video paused on frame 1 (damaged laptops)
2. **User scrolls down**: Video progresses frame-by-frame
3. **Scroll creates transformation**: User feels they're causing the magic
4. **Scroll up**: Video can reverse (optional)
5. **Full scroll**: Complete transformation revealed

## ðŸŽ¨ **Alternative 8-Second Concepts**

### Option B: Vertical Stack Transformation

- **Concept**: Camera tilts up through vertical stack of devices
- **Metaphor**: Scrolling through inventory grades
- **Advantage**: More compact for mobile viewing

### Option C: Conveyor Belt Process

- **Concept**: Devices travel through "Replugit transformation zone"
- **Metaphor**: Manufacturing efficiency
- **Highlight**: Green processing zone in center

### Option D: Split-Screen Wipe

- **Concept**: Screen wipes from damaged (left) to restored (right)
- **Metaphor**: Progressive web app reveal
- **Timing**: Smooth 8-second transition

## ðŸŽµ **Audio Design (8 seconds)**

### Sound Timeline

- **0-1s**: Ambient industrial noise (subtle)
- **1-3s**: Smooth whoosh as camera begins moving
- **3-6s**: Magical chimes for each transformation (3 total)
- **6-8s**: Satisfying completion tone, subtle logo audio

### Audio Style

- **Minimal and clean** - doesn't compete with visual
- **Professional corporate** tone
- **Subtle magical elements** for transformations
- **Web-optimized** file size

## ðŸ“± **Mobile Adaptation**

### Responsive Considerations

- **Fallback**: High-quality hero image for low bandwidth
- **Touch scrolling**: Smooth playback on mobile scroll
- **Vertical option**: 9:16 version for mobile-first design
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile processors

## ðŸš€ **Production Requirements**

### Props Needed

- 5 identical laptop models in various damage states
- 5 pristine versions of same models
- Professional studio setup
- Smooth camera tracking system

### Post-Production

- Color grading for dramatic contrast
- Green particle effects (#10B981)
- Text animation overlays
- Web optimization and compression

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Metrics**

### Engagement Goals

- **Increased scroll depth** - users scroll to see transformation
- **Longer page time** - engaging video keeps users watching
- **Higher conversion** - compelling visual builds trust
- **Social sharing** - satisfying transformation encourages shares
